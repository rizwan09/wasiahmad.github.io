I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/">CS@UCLA</a>.
  I work under the supervision of <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>.
<!--   Previously I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">CS@UVA</a> from August 2015 to August 2017. In fall 2017, I moved to UCLA with my advisor <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>.  -->
  My research interests span the areas of natural language processing (NLP) with a special focus on cross-lingual NLP.
<!--   My research efforts strike to develop computational algorithms that (1) reduce the amount of labeled data required to train NLP models from scratch; and (2) adapt to new domains and languages with fewer labeled examples. -->
  My research goal is to enhance the inclusion of technology for processing human languages by learning from limited labeled data.
<!-- Learning universal language representations utilizing data from heterogeneous sources, designing new learning objective to bridge the gap between different learning signals, and developing flexible model architectures to enable cross-domain and cross-language transfer is the fundamental objective of my research. My doctoral thesis is on transfer learning for low-resource natural language processing (NLP). -->
  During my Ph.D., I got the opportunity to work as a research intern at Facebook AI (Summer 2020), Yahoo Research (Summer 2019), Microsoft Research (Summer 2018), and @WalmartLabs (Summer 2016).

I have received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="http://cse.buet.ac.bd/">CSE@BUET</a>, in February 2013 and Master of Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">CS@UVA</a>, in August 2017. In my free time, I like to solve problems to improve my programming skill. I have given <b><font color="blue">500+</font></b> answers to programming related questions and earned <b><font color="blue">25,000+</font></b> reputation ðŸ˜Ž on StackOverflow.
